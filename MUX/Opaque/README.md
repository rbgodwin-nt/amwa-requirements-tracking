# NMOS Opaque Muxes Use-Cases and User-Stories

## Overview

This directory contains use-cases and user-stories focused on Networked Media Open Specifications (NMOS) Multiplexers (Muxes) that are considered "opaque". In this context, "opaque" refers to muxes where the contents or the media streams being multiplexed are not known or visible to NMOS directly. This characteristic presents unique challenges and opportunities in managing, routing, and interacting with these media streams in a professional broadcast environment.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:
- Outline real-world scenarios where opaque NMOS muxes are utilized.
- Detail the requirements and expectations for integrating opaque muxes within NMOS-controlled environments.
- Serve as a foundation for developing standards, tools, and practices to effectively manage opaque muxes.

## Scope

Contained within this directory are:
- **Use-Cases:** Detailed narratives that describe the processes or sequences of events involving opaque NMOS muxes in various operational contexts.
- **User-Stories:** Specific examples and scenarios provided by end-users, highlighting their needs, challenges, and desired outcomes when working with opaque muxes in an NMOS ecosystem.

## Definitions

- **NMOS:** Networked Media Open Specifications, a suite of open specifications and models for facilitating the discovery, registration, and connection management of media devices and services in a professional broadcast environment.
- **Mux (Multiplexer):** A device or process that combines multiple media streams into one.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're an end-user with a unique scenario involving opaque muxes, a developer with insights into managing such devices, or someone with questions or comments on the existing documentation, your input is valuable.
